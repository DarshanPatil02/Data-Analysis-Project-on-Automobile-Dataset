# Automobile Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project involves analyzing an automobile dataset to gain insights into various aspects of the data using the Pandas library in Python. The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and is in CSV format. The project is designed to guide users through data acquisition, cleaning, and analysis processes.

## Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:
- Acquire data from various sources and formats.
- Load datasets into Jupyter Notebook.
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Obtain insights from the data using the Pandas library.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/autos/imports-85.data)
- **Format**: CSV (Comma-Separated Values)

## Steps Involved

### 1. Data Acquisition
In this step, you will learn how to load a dataset into a Jupyter Notebook. The dataset for this project is an online CSV file. The Pandas library will be used to read the dataset into a DataFrame.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load the dataset
path = "https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DA0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Data%20files/auto.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(path, header=None)
```

### 2. Data Cleaning
This section covers cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and ensuring the data is in a suitable format for analysis.

### 3. Data Analysis
In this step, you will perform various analyses to gain insights from the dataset. This includes descriptive statistics, exploring data distributions, and identifying relationships between different variables.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/automobile-data-analysis.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd automobile-data-analysis
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies (if any).
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Data\ Analysis\ steps\ in\ IBM.ipynb
    ```
